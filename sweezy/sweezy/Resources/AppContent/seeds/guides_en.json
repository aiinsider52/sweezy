    "bodyMarkdown": "# Health Insurance in Switzerland\n\nHealth insurance is mandatory in Switzerland. Within 3 months of registration, you must choose an insurance company and sign up for basic coverage (Grundversicherung).\n\n> Important: Insurance is effective from your canton registration date, even if you sign up later. Delays can lead to back payments and penalties.\n\n---\n\n## What Basic Insurance Covers\n- Family doctor and specialist visits (with referral)\n- Medications from the official list, physiotherapy, lab tests\n- Hospital stays (within your canton), emergency care\n- Pregnancy, childbirth, emergency dental care\n\n## Insurance Models\n- [ ] **Standard** — free choice of doctor, more expensive\n- [ ] **HMO** — through family practice, cheaper\n- [ ] **Telmed** — phone/online consultation first, cheaper\n- [ ] **Hausarztmodell** — tied to family doctor\n\n> Tip: HMO and Telmed are usually 10–20% cheaper. Great if you rarely visit doctors.\n\n## Deductible and Co-payment\n- **Franchise (deductible)** — annual amount (300–2500 CHF). Higher deductible = lower monthly premium.\n- **Selbstbehalt (co-payment)** — 10% of costs after reaching deductible (max 700 CHF/year for adults).\n\n### Example Calculation\n- Deductible 300 CHF, you paid 500 CHF for medications. You pay 300 CHF deductible + 10% of remaining 200 CHF = 20 CHF. Total 320 CHF.\n- If deductible is 2500 CHF and you spent 500 CHF — you pay all 500 CHF yourself.\n\n---\n\n## How to Choose Insurance (Step by Step)\n1. Compare prices and models on **comparis.ch** or **bonus.ch**\n2. Choose a deductible based on your risk profile (if healthy — can be higher)\n3. Check discounts for alternative models (HMO/Telmed)\n4. Verify service language and partner clinics\n5. Apply online or in person. Policy and card will arrive by mail.\n6. Keep all treatment payment receipts!\n\n## Subsidies (Prämienverbilligung)\nIf your income is below the threshold, apply to the cantonal service (Sozialamt/AHV). Each canton has its own deadline and portal.\n\n### Documents for Subsidy\n- Income statement\n- Copy of policy\n- Residence permit (Ausweis S)\n- Certificate from Gemeinde\n\n> Important: Apply immediately after getting insurance. Subsidies are not retroactive!\n\n---\n\n## Useful Terms\n- **Hausarzt** — family doctor\n- **Notfall** — emergency\n- **Apotheke** — pharmacy\n- **Arzneimittelliste** — list of reimbursable medications\n- **Krankenkasse** — health insurance company\n\n## Emergency Numbers\n- **144** — ambulance\n- **143** — psychological support (anonymous)\n- **117** — police\n- **118** — fire department\n\n### Common Mistakes\n- Chose too high a deductible — large payments when visiting doctors\n- Missed the 3-month deadline — possible back payments\n- Didn't apply for subsidy on time\n- Didn't keep treatment payment receipts\n\n---\n\n## Additional Insurance (Optional)\n- **Dental** — basic insurance doesn't cover regular dental treatment\n- **Vision** — contacts and glasses aren't covered either\n- **Semi-private/private room** — for more comfortable hospital stays\n- **Alternative medicine** — homeopathy, acupuncture\n\n> Tip: Additional insurance is more expensive. Evaluate if you really need it.\n",
